Background Interaction detection methods have led to the discovery of thousands of interactions between proteins, and discerning relevance within large-scale data sets is important to present-day biology. The dataset consists of protein-protein interaction network described and analyzed in (1) and available as an example in the software package - PIN (2).

PIN class encoding:
1 - T, 2 - M, 3 - U, 4 - C, 5 - F, 6 - P, 7 - G, 8 - D, 9 - O, 10 - E, 11 - R, 12 - B, 13 - A.

yeastS.net X interacts with Y relation, short names. 
yeastL.net X interacts with Y relation, long labels. 
yeast.clu PIN class partition of vertices, see encoding.
